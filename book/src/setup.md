# Setup

To use SuperStruct in your project add `superstruct` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
superstruct = "0.4.0"
```

For the latest published version please consult [`crates.io`](https://crates.io/crates/superstruct).

----

To use SuperStruct, import the `superstruct` procedural macro with `use superstruct::superstruct`,
like so:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../examples/request.rs}}
```

For more information on this example see the [Introduction](./intro.md).
